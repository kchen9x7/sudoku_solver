# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the sudoku solver.:smiley: This is a project that contains a program allowing players to solve any standard 9 by 9 valid sudoku board that they wish. A proper sudoku board contains at least 17 clues and thus has one and only unique solution. In this case, only proper sudoku boards will be considered valid setup board inputs. Finally, upon running and setting up the program, player will be given two choices repeatedly in the next step, solve the puzzle or check the solution, until the player correctly answers the puzzle or gives up and checks the solution.
